## Reminders
Some reminders and notes on things that might be forgotten

### Atomic Structure and Lights
- The velocity of electron ejection is inversely proportional to the binding energy.
- Infrared radiation is used to study bonds within molecules.

### Kinetics
- When there is a table of time and concentration in kinetics, look for a half-life. 
- When mentioning collision theory, such as how particles colliding in the correct orientation initiates a reaction, mention activation energy. 


### Equilibrium
Includes Acid-Bases Equilibrium, $K_{sp}$, and buffers.

#### Ksp
- When looking for the minimum concentration required to form a precipitate, use $K_{sp}$ and the known concentration of another substance in the products.
- Use the concentration of dissolved substances to find $K_{sp}$ whenever possible and not from the molar solubility. 

#### Acid-Bases
- Remember to convert pH to pOH, and know clearly beforehand if the question is asking to find the concentration of $H^{+}$ or $OH^{-}$.
