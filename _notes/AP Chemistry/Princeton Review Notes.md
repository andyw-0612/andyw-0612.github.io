## Reminders
Some reminders and notes on things that might be forgotten

## Atomic Structure and Lights
- The velocity of electron ejection is inversely proportional to the binding energy.
- Infrared radiation is used to study bonds within molecules.

## Kinetics
- When there is a table of time and concentration in kinetics, look for a half-life. 
- When mentioning collision theory, such as how particles colliding in the correct orientation initiates a reaction, mention activation energy. 


## Equilibrium
Includes Acid-Bases Equilibrium, $K_{sp}$, and buffers.

### Ksp
- When looking for the minimum concentration required to form a precipitate, use $K_{sp}$ and the known concentration of another substance in the products.
- Use the concentration of dissolved substances to find $K_{sp}$ whenever possible and not from the molar solubility. 

### Acid-Bases
- Remember to convert pH to pOH, and know clearly beforehand if the question is asking to find the concentration of $H^{+}$ or $OH^{-}$. 
- Remember if the question is asking about a pH that is greater than 7 or less than 7.


## Electrochemistry 
-  When identifying which ==species== are oxidized/reduced, remember it is referring to the ion/molecule, not the actual element.
-  When the text says the element has no charge, then it does not. 

## Gas Laws
- Kinetic Moleular Theory
  1. As temperature increases, both the kinetic energy (collision with greater force) and average velocity of particle increases (more frequent collisions), resulting in a greater pressure.

## Net Ionics & Metal Trends
- $HCl + 2Zn^{2+} -> ZnCl_{2} + H_{2}
- Strong acids produce more concentration of $H^{+}$, thus is may react faster than using a weak acids.  

## IMFs
- Ion-Dipole forces are stronger than simply being polar. 
- Mention all types of IMFs when possible.


## Important Review Topics
- Kinetics
- Hess's Law
- Potential Energy Diagrams
	- High potential energy -> repulse
	- Low potential energy -> attract
- When coefficients double, K squares.
- Pay attention to what's provided in the original problem
- When K is greater than 0, G is less than 0
